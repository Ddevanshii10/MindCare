# MindCare : AI Driven Mental Health Support System

🧠 MindCare – AI-Driven Mental Health Support System
MindCare is an AI-powered application designed to provide preliminary mental health support by analyzing user input, classifying emotional states, and engaging through a smart chatbot interface. The project integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) with machine learning to understand the sentiments and mental well-being of users based on their text inputs.

🔍 Key Features & Components
🧩 1. Text Classification Using BERT
We fine-tuned the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for the text classification task.

This model helps in detecting specific mental health conditions or emotional categories from user input, enabling deeper understanding of the user's psychological state.

BERT's contextual understanding ensures high accuracy in understanding subtle nuances in language (e.g., sarcasm, anxiety-related expressions).

📊 2. Sentiment Analysis with VADER & Random Forest
VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is used for rule-based sentiment scoring.

Effective for quick classification into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Additionally, we used a Random Forest Classifier trained on labeled sentiment data to improve performance and handle more complex sentiment patterns.

This hybrid approach combines the interpretability of VADER with the robustness of ensemble learning.

🤖 3. Interactive Mental Health Chatbot
Built a chatbot interface that interacts with users in real-time.

The chatbot:

Analyzes messages using BERT and sentiment models.

Provides empathetic responses based on the classified mental state.

Offers general guidance or supportive prompts depending on user input.

Designed with a focus on non-judgmental, friendly, and accessible interactions.
